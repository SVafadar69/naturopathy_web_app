# Naturopathy AI Platform

A web application designed for naturopathic healthcare professionals to analyze medical documents, images, and audio recordings using artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Medical Document Analysis**: Upload and analyze patient records, lab reports, prescriptions (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT)
- **Medical Image Processing**: Analyze X-rays, lab results, skin conditions, and other medical imagery using AI vision
- **Patient Audio Notes**: Record consultations or upload audio files for automatic transcription
- **Patient Records Integration**: Connect with Google Docs for seamless record management
- **Secure Database Storage**: All patient data stored securely with PostgreSQL

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
1. An OpenAI API key (for AI analysis features)
2. Node.js installed on your computer (version 18 or higher)
3. A PostgreSQL database (can be set up automatically)

### Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (it starts with "sk-")
5. Keep this key secure - you'll need it for setup

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the code**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd naturopathy-app
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   Create a file called `.env` in the main folder and add:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application

## Database Setup

### Initial Database Creation

The application uses PostgreSQL to store patient records, medical documents, and analysis results. You have several options:

#### Option 1: Cloud Database (Recommended for Production)
1. **Create a cloud PostgreSQL database:**
   - Neon (free tier available): https://neon.tech
   - Supabase (free tier): https://supabase.com
   - Railway (free tier): https://railway.app
   - Or any PostgreSQL hosting provider

2. **Get your connection string:**
   After creating the database, you'll receive a connection URL that looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
   ```

3. **Add to your environment:**
   In your `.env` file, add:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
   ```

#### Option 2: Local Database
1. **Install PostgreSQL locally:**
   - Download from https://postgresql.org/download/
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - Remember the password you set during installation

2. **Create a database:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to PostgreSQL (replace 'postgres' with your username if different)
   psql -U postgres
   
   # Create a new database
   CREATE DATABASE naturopathy_app;
   
   # Exit PostgreSQL
   \q
   ```

3. **Set your connection string:**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/naturopathy_app
   ```

### Initialize Database Tables

After setting up your database connection:

1. **Create the database schema:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
   
   This command creates the necessary tables:
   - `uploads` - Stores information about uploaded files and AI analysis
   - `google_docs_settings` - Stores Google Docs integration settings

2. **Verify the setup:**
   The command should output:
   ```
   [âœ“] Changes applied
   ```

### Example Database Configuration

Here's a complete example of setting up with a cloud database:

**Step 1: Create account at Neon.tech**
- Sign up for free account
- Create new project called "naturopathy-app"
- Copy the connection string provided

**Step 2: Configure your environment**
Create `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-example-123456.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/naturopathy_app?sslmode=require
```

**Step 3: Initialize tables**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

**Step 4: Start the application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your database will now store:
- Patient document uploads and AI analysis results
- Medical image analysis data  
- Audio transcriptions from patient consultations
- Google Docs integration settings

## How to Use

### Upload Medical Documents
1. Click on the "Documents" tab
2. Drag and drop files or click "Browse Files"
3. The AI will automatically analyze the content
4. View the analysis results below your upload

### Analyze Medical Images
1. Click on the "Images" tab
2. Upload images of X-rays, lab results, or other medical imagery
3. The AI will provide detailed analysis of what it observes
4. Copy or save the analysis for your records

### Record Patient Audio
1. Click on the "Audio" tab
2. Click the microphone button to start recording
3. Speak your notes or patient consultation details
4. The audio will be automatically transcribed to text
5. Review and save the transcription

1. After processing any file, click "Upload to Docs"
2. Connect your Google account when prompted
3. The analysis will be saved to your Google Docs
